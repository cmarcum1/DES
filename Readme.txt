Programming Assignment 1 (DES) Readme File

This program works completely there are no known bugs.
This program outputs three file for every time it encrypts and decrypts a message. 
The first file is "Debug Log Key”, which describes the key scheduler process.
The first file is "Debug Log Message”, which describes the encryption process.
The third file is "Final Output", which describes the encrypted message and then the decrypted message of the program.

This program is created in Java.
To compile, type "javac DES.java" (it will compile all the other files that it is linked too).
To run the program type "java DES"

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Thanks
